There are only seven types of sentences in the English language–you can read more about them here. The goal of this activity is to write functions in python that generate sentences by randomly selecting the elements of each type of sentence. 

The first type–a simple sentence–has already been done for you, as an example. 

1. Uncomment the compound_sentence( ) function and add code that randomly generates and joins two independent clauses, using a conjunction.  

2. Uncomment the complex_sentence( ) function and add code that randomly generates and joins a dependent and an independent clause.

3. Uncomment the compound_complex_sentence( ) function and add code that randomly generates and joins a dependent clause with an independent clause, a conjunction, and an independent clause.
